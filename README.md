Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup iOS Webtiles wrapper

## Summary

This project aims to make DCSS webtiles a joy to play on any iOS device without an external keyboard. Works best in iPad devices.

The webtiles UI has a few problems:
* No way to bring up a system keyboard forcing the use of an external keyboard
* Hard to play without access to normal keyboard keys like: arrow keys, return, escape, etc.
* Some automatic web browser behaviors (e.g. auto magnification of text boxes) make things clunky

## How to play

* Launch the app
* Login to your webtiles account
* Use the built in bar at the bottom to send key commands to the game
* Long press any command to repeatedly send it to the game
* Swipe up on the bar to access a secondary set of commands

## Built in commands

* Shortcuts for auto-explore, auto-combat, rest
* Arrow keys (nw, ne, se, sw directions are part of the secondary commands)
* Escape key
* Bring up and enter commands using any iOS Keyboard
* Find an item
